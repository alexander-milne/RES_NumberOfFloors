# RES_NumberOfFloors

This project calculates the number of possible combinations in a theoretical apartment block where there are 2 types of apartments.

1-> Large appartments, these take up 2 floors
2-> Small appartments, these take up 1 floor

example-> An appartment block with 4 floors has 5 possible combinations:

1: ssss
2: lss
3: sls
4: ssl
5: ll



example-> An appartment block with 5 floors has 8 possible combinations:

1: sssss
2: lsss  -> 6: lls -> 8: lsl
3: slss  -> 7: sll
4: ssls
5: sssl
