### Description
This project calculates the number of possible combinations in a theoretical apartment block where there are 2 types of apartments.

1-> Large appartments, these take up 2 floors

2-> Small appartments, these take up 1 floor

1. ssss
1. lss
1. sls
1. ssl
1. ll


## Example 2
An appartment block with 5 floors has 8 possible combinations:

1: sssss
2: lsss  -> 6: lls -> 8: lsl
3: slss  -> 7: sll
4: ssls
5: sssl
